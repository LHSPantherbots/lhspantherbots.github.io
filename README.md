# A Message from Hayden

This was just kind of a goof to test what is possible with Github pages. So far, a lot of this website has been made by ChatGPT (and it shows!). It might be fun for me to work on this over time, widdling away to make it better and more pleasant on the eyes. If any of the team members wish to make contributions to this repo so they can become more familiar with Git and GitHub, they are more than free to do so. 

## Purpose

As mentioned in the preamble, the primary objective for this repo and website is currently just as a means to mess around with GitHub pages and to become more comfortable utilizng git command interface. However, if deemed appropriate by team leadership, this repo could expand to replace the [current 2582 website](http://lufkinpantherbots.com/). By being hosted on GitHub, the website will recieve a signifigant upgrade in both security and ease in customization. Moreover, this will free up the PR team from their responsibilty from maintianing the website and better shift their focus to providing content for the website, i.e. photos, videos, and press releases. This project also hopes to establish greater subteam synergy, by encouraging collabaoration between the Programming and PR subteams. Lastly, by hosting on GitHub, the team website can enjoy more frequent updates, as access can be made avalible to everyone who has access to the PantherBots Orginization on GitHub, not just to a select few members on PR who have the technical know-how to access and update the current website. 

## How this project can be improved

Everything not in this ``README`` has been written by AI, and so is very sloopy and could use some cleaning up (now that I think about it, the `README` could also use some polishing, I only write first drafts). Instructions being written on how to properly access this repo (and thus all GitHub repos) could also go a long way. I am highly partial to utilizing [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) and [GitHub Wiki](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis) for planning and documentation creation. Therefore, we can utilize this repo as a testing ground for mutiple GitHub features, and see if they make sense to implement into our repos going further. If you have any other ideas on how to improve this repo, be sure to edit this `README`! Here are some [tips](https://www.markdownlang.com/basic/overview.html) on how to do that.

## How to actually contribute to the repo

You may want to refer to the documentation on [using Git in VS Code](https://github.com/LHSPantherbots/lhspantherbots.github.io/wiki/Basics-to-using-Git-in-VSCode)

You are going to need to [clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

After cloning the repo, you are going to want to [create your own branch](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_branches-and-tags)

Then, you can read and edit the code as you see fit. Be sure to check out the [issues page](https://github.com/LHSPantherbots/lhspantherbots.github.io/issues) if you need to be pointed in the direction of what needs to be done.

To see a preview of the changes you made, you can right click the file named `index.html`, select `copy path` and then paste that path into your web browser of choice.

After making changes, commit your changes to the branch you created, then make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to merge the branch to its parent (if you think it is approriate to do so).

Here are some resources to help you out:
* [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to help format the `README`
* [HTML Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), don't worry about extensivly learning HTML, this resource is just a refrence. Often times, AI will also be useful in formatting HTML
* [CSS Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) same notes as above
* [JavaScript Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/js/). Again, don't worry too much about learning this language. During the season, we will primarly use [Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/) to programe the robot.
