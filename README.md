A Website for the LHS Pantherbot Programming Team, an experiment in GitHub Pages and more dynamic website experience

The following was typed by ChatGPT: 

## What I added

This repository now includes a small, responsive website template you can use for the team.

- `index.html` — the homepage with sections (About, Projects, Team, Contact)
- `styles.css` — lightweight responsive styling with a dark/light theme
- `script.js` — minimal JS for mobile nav, theme toggle, and a demo contact handler
- `assets/logo.svg` — a small SVG logo used as favicon and illustrations


# A Message from Hayden

This was just kind of a goof to test what is possible with Github pages. So far, everything in this website has been made by ChatGPT (and it shows!). It might be fun for me to work on this over time, widdling away to make it better and more pleasant on the eyes. If any of the team members wish to make contributions to this repo so they can become more familiar with Git and GitHub, they are more than free to do so. 

## Purpose

As mentioned in the preamble, the primary objective for this repo and website is currently just as a means to mess around with GitHub pages and to become more comfortable utilizng git command interface. However, if deemed appropriate by team leadership, this repo could expand to replace the [current 2582 website](http://lufkinpantherbots.com/). By being hosted on GitHub, the website will recieve a signifigant upgrade in both security and ease in customization. Moreover, this will free up the PR team from their responsibilty from maintianing the website and better shift their focus to providing content for the website, i.e. photos, videos, and press releases. This project also hopes to establish greater subteam synergy, by encouraging collabaoration between the Programming and PR subteams. Lastly, by hosting on GitHub, the team website can enjoy more frequent updates, as access can be made avalible to everyone who has access to the PantherBots Orginization on GitHub, not just to a select few members on PR who have the technical know-how to access and update the current website. 

## How this project can be improved

Everything not in this ``README`` has been written by AI, and so is very sloopy and could use some cleaning up (now that I think about it, the `README` could also use some polishing, I only write first drafts). Instructions being written on how to properly access this repo (and thus all GitHub repos) could also go a long way. I am highly partial to utilizing [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) and [GitHub Wiki](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis) for planning and documentation creation. Therefore, we can utilize this repo as a testing ground for mutiple GitHub features, and see if they make sense to implement into our repos going further. If you have any other ideas on how to improve this repo, be sure to edit this `README`! Here are some [tips](https://www.markdownlang.com/basic/overview.html) on how to do that.
